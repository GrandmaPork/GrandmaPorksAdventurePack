My Adventure Pack aims to combine elements of building, combat, and exploration all into one pack! I also want to keep things as light as possible so my friends and I can also run it, as well as others who don't have the most powerful rigs. Currently, the pack is on version 1.18.2 but I will be updating it to 1.20.1 or another version years into the future, when I have the time, money, and programming experience. Until then, I will be releasing "mini adventures" which will be smaller, unpolished packs that I will run with my friends and see what everyone enjoys. This project will remain relatively empty.
